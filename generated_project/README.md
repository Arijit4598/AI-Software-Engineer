# Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a simple web project that demonstrates a basic interactive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The `index.html` file serves as the entry point, loading the stylesheet and script to provide a responsive UI.

## Features

- Clean, responsive layout styled with **CSS**.
- Interactive behavior powered by **JavaScript** (`script.js`).
- No external dependencies; runs entirely in the browser.
- Accessible navigation via mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Markup    | HTML5      |
| Styling   | CSS3       |
| Logic     | Vanilla JavaScript |

## Setup

1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). No server is required because the project consists of static files.

   ```bash
   # From the project root directory
   open index.html   # macOS
   # or
   start index.html  # Windows
   # or simply double‑click the file in your file explorer.
   ```

## Usage

- **Mouse**: Click on the interactive elements (buttons, links, etc.) to trigger the JavaScript functionality.
- **Keyboard**: Use the `Tab` key to navigate focusable elements and press `Enter` or `Space` to activate them.

The UI updates in real‑time based on your interactions, demonstrating how the script manipulates the DOM.

## Development

If you want to modify or extend the project:

1. **Edit HTML** – Open `index.html` and adjust the markup as needed.
2. **Edit Styles** – Modify `styles.css` to change the look and feel.
3. **Edit Logic** – Update `script.js` to add or change interactive behavior.

After saving changes, simply refresh the browser page to see the updates.

### Running a Local Development Server (optional)

While not required, you can serve the files via a simple HTTP server to avoid any CORS issues when loading resources.

```bash
# Using Python 3 (built‑in)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
```
